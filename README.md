*Simon Says Game*
How to play?
# there will be 4 colors, a color will blink when the game starts.
# click on the same color which blinked and if u got it right, u'll advance to nect lvl/round
# now 2 colors will blink, repeat the sequence to go to next lvl n it goes on
# number of color blink = level
See how far u can do ;)
